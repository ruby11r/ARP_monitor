ARP table manipulation and monitoring irregularities

### NOTE
This repo contains experimental code developed soly for research and learning purpose.

### Background
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing or ARP cache poisoning, is a network attack technique where an attacker sends unsolicitated ARP messages over a local network. These messages associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another device, such as the default gateway. <br/>
This deception can redirect traffic intended for the legitimate device to the attacker's machine, allowing them to intercept, modify, or stop the data. ARP poisoning is often used in conjunction with other attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, to eavesdrop on network communications or launch further exploits. This repository provides tools, scripts, and resources to understand, detect, and mitigate ARP poisoning attacks, helping users secure their networks against these threats.
